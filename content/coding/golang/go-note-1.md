### Go Introduction

> Golang's popularity is skyrocketing. The thriving of Docker and Kubernetes push the Golang to a higher level. 

> Go is easy to become functional with and appropriate for junior developers to work on. Also, having a language that encourages readability and comprehension is extremely useful. The mixture of duck typing (via interfaces) and convenience features such as ":=" for short variable declarations give Go the feel of a dynamically typed language while retaining the positives of a strongly typed one.

> Go's native concurrency is a boon for network applications that live and die on concurrency. Go is an explicitly engineered programming language, specifically designed with these new requirements in mind. Written expressly for the cloud, Go has been growing in popularity because of its mastery of concurrent operations and the beauty of its construction.
