title = "Angularjs Webpack ES6 Starter"
description = "This starter was inspired by another similar angular webpack starter repository"

## Summary

It simply includes font-awesome, bootstrap for the people who don't want to use boostrap-webpack, font-awesome-webpack. I find it saves us so much effort to create prototype, since we don't need spectacular UI.


* This starter uses angular 1.5 for someone want to build component.
* This repo follows mvc patterns instead of component pattern. 
* ES6, and ES7 support with babel.
* Development server with live reload.
* Production builds with cache busting.
* Testing environment using karma to run tests and jasmine as the framework.
* Code coverage when tests are run.
* Include font-awesome without font-awesome-loader.
* Include Bootstrap 3 without bootstrap-loader.
* No gulp and no grunt, just npm scripts.
