## Azure App Service


Azure App Service is an HTTP-based service for hosting web applications, REST APIs, and mobile back ends. You can develop in your favorite language, be it .NET, .NET Core, Java, Ruby, Node.js, PHP, or Python. Applications run and scale with ease on both Windows and Linux-based environments.

* Built-in auto scale support

* Continuous integration/deployment support

* Deployment slots


### Limitations

* App Service on Linux is not supported on Shared pricing tier.
* You can't mix Windows and Linux apps in the same App Service plan.
* The Azure portal shows only features that currently work for Linux apps.
